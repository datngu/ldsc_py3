# LDSC (LD SCore) `v1.0.2`

`ldsc` is a command line tool for estimating heritability and genetic correlation from GWAS summary statistics. `ldsc` also computes LD Scores.

## Python 3 Compatibility

This repository is a Python 3 compatible fork of the original [LDSC project](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc). The codebase has been updated to work with modern Python 3.8+ environments while maintaining the same functionality.

Key improvements include:
- Compatible with Python 3.8 and newer
- Updated dependency requirements
- Fixed syntax for print statements, file handling, and other Python 2 specific code
- Modern pandas interface usage

## Getting Started

In order to download `ldsc`, you should clone this repository via the commands:
```  
git clone https://github.com/buutrg/ldsc_py3.git
cd ldsc_py3
```

In order to install the Python dependencies, you will need the [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) Python distribution and package manager. After installing Anaconda/Miniconda, run the following commands to create an environment with LDSC's dependencies:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate ldsc_py3
```

This will create a Python 3.8 environment with all the necessary dependencies.

Once the above has completed, you can run:

```
./ldsc.py -h
./munge_sumstats.py -h
```
to print a list of all command-line options. If these commands fail with an error, then something has gone wrong during the installation process. 

Short tutorials describing the four basic functions of `ldsc` (estimating LD Scores, h2 and partitioned h2, genetic correlation, the LD Score regression intercept) can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki). If you would like to run the tests, please see the wiki.

## Updating LDSC

You can update to the newest version of `ldsc` using `git`. First, navigate to your `ldsc_py3/` directory (e.g., `cd ldsc_py3`), then run:
```
git pull
```
If `ldsc` is up to date, you will see: 
```
Already up-to-date.
```
Otherwise, you will see `git` output telling you which files were changed. If you have modified the `ldsc` source code, `git pull` may fail with an error such as `error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:`. 

In case the Python dependencies have changed, you can update the LDSC environment with:

```
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

## Python Version Compatibility

This fork has been specifically created to work with Python 3.8+. The original [LDSC project](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) is compatible with Python 2.7, which is now deprecated.

Major changes in this Python 3 version include:
- Updated dependency versions in environment.yml and requirements.txt
- Modernized print() function calls
- Replaced xrange() with range()
- Updated file handling with correct text/binary mode
- Fixed pandas DataFrame and Series methods to use newer interfaces
- Explicit encoding specifications for file operations
- Proper handling of dictionary views vs. lists

All functionality remains the same as the original project with these implementation updates.

## Where Can I Get LD Scores?

You can download [European](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2) and [East Asian LD Scores](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eas_ldscores.tar.bz2) from 1000 Genomes [here](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/). These LD Scores are suitable for basic LD Score analyses (the LD Score regression intercept, heritability, genetic correlation, cross-sex genetic correlation). You can download partitioned LD Scores for partitioned heritability estimation [here](http://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/).
